Heatbeats Classifier Software based in Artificial Neuronal Network(ANN).

This software is developed to be run on a Zybo board (Zynq 7010 ARM CPU) in 
order to check the proper working of the algorithm. The goal of the project is 
to implement this algorithm on FPGA.

This is a continuation of ANN_Microblaze_project.
